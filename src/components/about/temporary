    <div><h1>Recruit scholars</h1>
    <p className='service_text'>
    We reach out to schools in rural areas, through conducting workshops and using online broadcasting methods, to identify students who are highly talented but come from low-income backgrounds. We distribute application forms to these students and invite them to apply to become scholars in our program. Those who are qualified are then chosen and recruited to receive our services.

    <div><h1>Prepare our scholars</h1>
    <p className='service_text'>
    As part of our preparation toward school and scholarship applications, we coach our scholars on how to write scholarship and school application essays, introduce them to LinkedIn, and educate them on how to send out professional e-mails.    </p>

    <div><h1>Support our scholars</h1>
    <p className='service_text'>
    We assist our scholars with application fee waivers. We strive to assist our scholars in securing scholarships in top-tier universities in Ghana and abroad. While our scholars are in school, we provide them with buddy-up coaching, mentorship and job shadowing assistances. We also assist them in securing internship opportunities.    </p>
